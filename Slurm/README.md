# Slurm Scripts

This folder contains a collection of Bash scripts designed for submission to the Slurm workload manager.

## Important:

Before submitting any script, make sure to update the base directory placeholder (`[base-directory]`) to the correct path where this repository is stored on your system.

To save time, it's recommended to batch-rename the base directory placeholder across all scripts at once.
