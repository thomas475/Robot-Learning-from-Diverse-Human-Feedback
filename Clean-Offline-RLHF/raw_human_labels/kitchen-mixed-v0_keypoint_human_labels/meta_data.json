The scene includes an openable microwave, four turnable oven burners, an oven light switch, a freely movable kettle, two hinged cabinets, and a sliding cabinet door. The goal is to achieve the following four subtasks: </p><p>\u2022Open the microwave</p><p>\u2022Move the kettle</p><p>\u2022Turn on the light switch</p><p>\u2022Turn on the bottom left burner</p><p>You see an example of the agent trying to solve the task. Keypoints are frames in the video that capture important information or significant milestones, such as completing a subgoal. Identify and mark these keypoints.</p>",
